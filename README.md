## About

FABO is a quirky command-line interface (CLI) tool we wish to build. It tracks various media channels for milestone events, such as when your GitHub repository reaches those 1,000 shiny stars or your LinkedIn profile gets the first 100 followers. FABO automatically captures screenshots of these milestones, allowing you to celebrate and share your social media achievements easily and without fear of missing out.

While FABO is still in its conception stages, we're working hard to bring you an exciting and feature-rich tool that will make tracking your milestone proofs a breeze. We can't wait to share it with you all and see what cool ideas you have to make it even better!

## Getting Started

*FABO is currently in development, but we're cooking up something special! Installation instructions will be provided when we're ready to share this quirky creation with the world.*

## Roadmap

We have an ambitious (and maybe a little quirky) roadmap planned for FABO, with exciting features and improvements on the horizon. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and upcoming releases!

## Contributing

While FABO is still in its early stages, we welcome contributions from the community – the quirkier, the better! We'd love to hear if you have a wild idea or unique perspective to share. Keep an eye on this repository for updates.

## Support

If you have any questions, need assistance, or want to chat about FABO's features, feel free to open an issue on this repository, and we'll be happy to lend an ear!

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Feel free to use it, modify it, and have a blast with it!

## Note

This is a work of fiction. Any similarity to actual events or persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. FABO is a whimsical, imaginary character I dreamed up while attempting to capture screenshots of our milestones as we approached [4,000 stars with Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona). Despite consistently failing at this task, our teammate [Fabo](https://soundcloud.com/sckasturi/8-bit-rick-roll-but-drill) always swooped in to save the day.
Who knows? Maybe our little FABO will even materialize at one point! God knows we all need FABO in our screen-shooting lives.

## Getting started

You can run and edit the algorithms or contribute to them using [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/), a free online development environment, with a single click.
